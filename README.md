# Covid19 Detection
We attempted to use a machine learning model that makes use of CNN's and Inception V3's capabilities to predict the presence of diseases such as COVID-19, pneumonia, fibrosis, tuberculosis, etc. from CT scans. Using the accuracy and loss of the different models, we attempted to compare the model.
